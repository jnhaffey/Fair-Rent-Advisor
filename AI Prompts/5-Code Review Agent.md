- [ ] Postcode value object with UK format validation
- [ ] MonthlyRent value object with business rules and currency support
- [ ] PropertyType value object with type safety and string conversion
- [ ] 100% unit test coverage for all value objects

## Critical Areas for Review

### üö® Must Verify Before Proceeding
1. **Project Structure Completeness**
   - Verify all required projects are created and properly referenced
   - Confirm solution file includes all projects
   - Check that project references are correctly configured

2. **Package Dependencies**
   - Validate all specified NuGet packages are installed with correct versions
   - Ensure React project has required TypeScript and Material-UI packages
   - Confirm test projects have xUnit, FluentAssertions, and Moq

3. **TDD Implementation Validation**
   - **CRITICAL**: Verify Red-Green-Refactor cycle was followed
   - Confirm tests were written BEFORE implementation code
   - Validate 100% test coverage for value objects
   - Ensure all tests pass consistently

4. **Value Object Implementation Quality**
   - Postcode: UK format validation, outward/inward code extraction
   - MonthlyRent: Negative amount prevention, currency support, realistic limits
   - PropertyType: Type safety, string conversion, predefined instances

5. **Local Development Environment**
   - Docker Compose configuration for Cosmos DB and Redis emulators
   - Local development scripts functionality
   - Environment configuration files (local.settings.json, etc.)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Architecture Compliance Check
1. **No AutoMapper Usage**: Confirm manual object mapping approach
2. **Dependency Injection**: Verify Azure Functions DI container setup
3. **Repository Pattern**: Check interface definitions are in place
4. **Serialization**: Validate System.Text.Json attributes for Cosmos DB

### üí° Code Quality Assessment
1. **Test Quality**: Meaningful test names, proper AAA pattern, edge cases covered
2. **Error Handling**: Appropriate exceptions with descriptive messages  
3. **Code Documentation**: XML comments for public APIs
4. **Naming Conventions**: PascalCase for C#, camelCase for TypeScript

## Review Questions for Software Engineer Agent

### Phase 1 Infrastructure Setup
1. Can you demonstrate that `dotnet build` succeeds for the entire solution?
2. Do `docker-compose up -d` commands start Cosmos DB and Redis emulators successfully?
3. Are all project references correctly configured and resolvable?
4. Does the React frontend start without errors using `npm start`?
5. Do the local development scripts execute without errors?

### Phase 2A TDD Implementation
1. Can you provide evidence of the Red-Green-Refactor cycle being followed?
2. Do all unit tests pass when running `dotnet test`?
3. What is the actual code coverage percentage for value objects?
4. Are the value objects properly serializable to/from JSON for Cosmos DB?
5. Do the implicit conversions work correctly in all test scenarios?

### Specific Implementation Validation
1. **Postcode Value Object**:
   - Does it correctly validate UK postcode formats?
   - Are case-insensitive inputs handled properly?
   - Does it correctly extract outward and inward codes?

2. **MonthlyRent Value Object**:
   - Are negative amounts properly rejected?
   - Does the upper limit validation work (50,000+ rejection)?
   - Are different currencies supported correctly?

3. **PropertyType Value Object**:
   - Do the predefined static instances work correctly?
   - Does `FromString()` handle all specified mappings?
   - Are invalid property types properly rejected?

## Test Execution Requirements

Please provide the following evidence:

### Build and Test Results
```bash
# Full solution build
dotnet build

# Complete test execution with results
dotnet test --verbosity normal --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"

# Frontend build verification  
cd src/FairRentAdvisor.Web && npm install && npm run build
```

### Test Coverage Report
- Provide code coverage percentages for each value object
- Confirm 100% coverage target is met
- Show test execution summary with pass/fail counts

### Local Environment Verification
```bash
# Emulator startup
docker-compose up -d

# Health check commands
docker ps
curl http://localhost:8081/_explorer/index.html (Cosmos DB)
redis-cli ping (Redis)
```

## Documentation Requirements

Please provide:
1. **README.md** updates with setup instructions
2. **Test execution guide** with coverage reports  
3. **Local development workflow** documentation
4. Any **architectural decision records** for implementation choices

## Next Steps Preparation

Before proceeding to the next phase, ensure:
- [ ] All tests consistently pass in clean environment
- [ ] Local emulators start and remain stable
- [ ] Project builds without warnings or errors
- [ ] Code coverage meets 100% target for value objects
- [ ] TDD evidence is documented and verifiable

## Re-review Required
**Yes** - This review requires demonstration of successful implementation before proceeding to Phase 2B (Property Entities).

**Focus Areas for Re-review**:
1. Complete test execution results with coverage
2. Working local development environment demonstration
3. Evidence of TDD methodology compliance
4. Value object implementation quality verification

The foundation established in these phases is critical for the entire application. Please provide comprehensive evidence that all requirements have been met before moving forward with entity implementation.
