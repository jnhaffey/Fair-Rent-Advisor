# Fair Rent Advisor Project Context

This is an AI-driven SaaS project using .NET 8 backend (Azure Functions) and React TypeScript frontend. The development process follows an agent-based workflow where Claude agents generate implementation prompts for Cursor AI to execute.

## General Principles

### Code Quality
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow SOLID principles and clean architecture patterns
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add comments only when necessary to explain "why", not "what"
- Keep functions and classes focused on single responsibilities

### Testing
- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Aim for high test coverage (80%+)
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in tests
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

### Error Handling
- Use proper exception handling with specific exception types
- Log errors with appropriate context and severity levels
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Handle edge cases gracefully

### Git Practices
- Use conventional commit messages (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Use feature branches for development

### Documentation
- Update README.md for significant changes
- Document API endpoints with proper examples
- Keep architectural decisions recorded
- Update changelog for releases
