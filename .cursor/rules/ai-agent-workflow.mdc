# AI Agent Integration and Workflow

## Prompt Engineering
- Provide clear, specific requirements to agents
- Include relevant context and constraints
- Specify expected outcomes and success criteria
- Request code examples when helpful

## Code Generation
- Review all AI-generated code thoroughly
- Ensure generated code follows project rules
- Test AI-generated code comprehensively
- Refactor if necessary to meet standards

## Agent Iteration Process
1. Product Manager Agent defines requirements
2. Architecture Agent validates design
3. Software Engineer Agent creates implementation prompts
4. Cursor AI implements code following these rules
5. Code Review Agent validates implementation
6. QA Engineer Agent plans testing approach

## Workflow Automation Rules

### Prompt Documentation
- Only save prompts that include an AGENT TYPE specification (e.g., "# AGENT TYPE: SOFTWARE ENGINEER AGENT")
- If no AGENT TYPE is provided in the prompt, do not record the prompt
- Use the naming convention: `#-{AGENT-TYPE}.md` (where # is the next sequential number AND {AGENT-TYPE} is the AGENT TYPE provided in the prompt)
- Include the full prompt text, context, and any relevant details
- This maintains a complete record of the AI-driven development process

#### Special Case: Code Reviewer Results
- When the AGENT TYPE Code Reviewer is executing checks, save the results with the naming convention: `#r-Code Reviewer Agent.md` (where # represents the last Code Reviewer Agent Prompt number)
- This distinguishes between the original Code Reviewer prompt and its execution results

### Changelog Management
- Every time changes are committed, update the `docs/changelog.md` file to reflect the changes
- Follow the Keep a Changelog format (https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
- Categorize changes as: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security
- Include commit hash and date for traceability
- Include a well worded version of the commit message
- Move items from [Unreleased] to appropriate version sections when releasing

## Code Reviews
- All code should be reviewed before merging
- Use the Code Review Agent for AI-assisted reviews
- Check for security vulnerabilities
- Verify test coverage and quality
